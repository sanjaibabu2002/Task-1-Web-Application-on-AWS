# Task One: Deploying a Web Application on AWS
Learn the basics of deploying a simple web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS), including server setup, application hosting, and configuration.

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
*Launch an EC2 instance.
*Configure a web server.
*Deploy and host a web application.

# Prerequisites
An AWS account.
Basic knowledge of web servers and command-line tools.
A simple web application to deploy (e.g., HTML, CSS files).

# How to Do It (Steps)
1. Launch an EC2 Instance:
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 and launch an instance with a Linux-based AMI.
Configure the instance type, storage, and security groups (allow HTTP and SSH).
2. Connect to the Instance:
Use an SSH client to connect to the server using the key pair created during setup.
3. Set Up the Web Server:
Install a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) using the package manager.
Start the web server and configure it to run on port 80.
4. Deploy the Application:
Upload your web application files to the web server's root directory (e.g., /var/www/html for Apache).
5.Access the Application:
Use the public IP address of the instance to view the deployed application in a browser.
6. Clean Up:
Terminate the EC2 instance if no longer needed to avoid incurring additional charges.
